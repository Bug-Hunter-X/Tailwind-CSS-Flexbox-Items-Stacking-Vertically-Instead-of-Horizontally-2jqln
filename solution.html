The issue was likely caused by an unintended `flex-direction: column;` style applied either directly to the parent container or inherited from an ancestor element. To fix this, ensure that the parent container's flex-direction is set to `row` (the default, but worth checking). You can explicitly set it using:

```html
<div class="flex flex-row">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 w-20 h-20"></div>
  <div class="bg-red-500 w-20 h-20"></div>
</div>
```

Alternatively, check for any conflicting styles applied via CSS rules or parent elements.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and determine if any unexpected styles are being applied.
