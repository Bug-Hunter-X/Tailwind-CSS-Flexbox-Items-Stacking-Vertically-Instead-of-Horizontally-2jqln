The following code uses Tailwind's `flex` utility class, but the items are not displaying correctly.  The expected behavior is that the items should be arranged horizontally, but they are stacking vertically instead.

```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 w-20 h-20"></div>
  <div class="bg-red-500 w-20 h-20"></div>
</div>
```
